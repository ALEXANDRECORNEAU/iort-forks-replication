DeepLearning-in-ESP32,"Object detection and identification is one of the most important and challenging branches of computer vision, which has been widely applied in peoples’ life, such as monitoring security, autonomous driving, and so on, with the purpose of locating instances of semantic objects of a certain class. With the rapid development of deep learning networks for detection tasks, the performance of object detectors has been greatly improved. By using Machine Learning and ResNet, we can easily identify the names of the objects which we needed. For this, firstly the training data is fed to the machine and labeled it correctly based on the nomenclature. By using the Camera Module, the test data is detected and verified with the train data using the ResNet algorithm. By repeated testing of the objects, the data set is updated or deleted based on the errors made by the machine in identification. On the repeated iteration of identifying the objects correctly ie., Accuracy reaching ≥ 95%, the dataset, and the application is used in Real World for automation. For this, I use Keras, an open-source neural-network library written in Python and by using the IoT module, the identified data is transferred to the Display device wirelessly. In Real-Time, this project is used for the identification of objects with more than 95% accuracy and transmit the data from anywhere and anytime using the cloud, and completely automate the process and reduces the manpower.  ESP32 :  Engineered for mobile devices, wearable electronics and IoT applications, ESP32 achieves ultra-low power consumption with a combination of several types of proprietary software. ESP32 also includes state-of-the-art features, such as fine-grained clock gating, various power modes and dynamic power scaling.",https://api.github.com/repos/AnbuKumar-maker/DeepLearning-in-ESP32/commits,5,0,0,2020-11-03T09:03:22Z,2021-10-22T04:06:25Z

6S191_MIT_DeepLearning,"MIT Introduction to Deep Learning (6.S191) Instructors: Alexander Amini and Ava Soleimany Course Information Summary Prerequisites Schedule Lectures Labs, Final Projects, Grading, and Prizes Software labs Gather.Town lab + Office Hour sessions Final project Paper Review Project Proposal Presentation Project Proposal Grading Rubric Past Project Proposal Ideas Awards + Categories Important Links and Emails Course Information Summary MIT's introductory course on deep learning methods with applications to computer vision, natural language processing, biology, and more! Students will gain foundational knowledge of deep learning algorithms and get practical experience in building neural networks in TensorFlow. Course concludes with a project proposal competition with feedback from staff and a panel of industry sponsors.  Prerequisites  We expect basic knowledge of calculus (e.g., taking derivatives), linear algebra (e.g., matrix multiplication), and probability (e.g., Bayes theorem) -- we'll try to explain everything else along the way! Experience in Python is helpful but not necessary. This class is taught during MIT's IAP term by current MIT PhD researchers. Listeners are welcome!

Current MIT students, faculty, postdocs, researchers, staff, etc. will be able to access the lectures during this two week period, synchronously or asynchronously, via the MIT Canvas course webpage (MIT internal only). Lecture recordings will be uploaded to the Canvas as soon as possible; students are not required to attend any lectures synchronously. Please see the Canvas for details on Zoom links.  The public edition of the course will only be made available after completion of the MIT course. Labs, Final Projects, Grading, and Prizes Course will be graded during MIT IAP for 6 units under P/D/F grading. Receiving a passing grade requires completion of each software lab project (through honor code, with submission required to enter lab competitions), a final project proposal/presentation or written review of a deep learning paper (submission required), and attendance/lecture viewing (through honor code). Submission of a written report or presentation of a project proposal will ensure a passing grade.  MIT students will be eligible for prizes and awards as part of the class competitions. There will be two parts to the competitions: (1) software labs and (2) final projects. More information is provided below. Winners will be announced on the last day of class, with thousands of dollars of prizes being given away!  Software labs There are three TensorFlow software lab exercises for the course, designed as iPython notebooks hosted in Google Colab. Software labs can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning. These are self-paced exercises and are designed to help you gain practical experience implementing neural networks in TensorFlow.  For registered MIT students, submission of lab materials is not necessary to get credit for the course or to pass the course.  At the end of each software lab there will be task-associated materials to submit (along with instructions) for entry into the competitions, open to MIT students and affiliates during the IAP offering. This includes MIT students/affiliates who are taking the class as listeners -- you are eligible!  These instructions are provided at the end of each of the labs. Completing these tasks and submitting your materials to Canvas will enter you into a per-lab competition. MIT students and affiliates will be eligible for prizes during the IAP offering; at the end of the course, prize-winners will be awarded with their prizes.  All competition submissions are due on January 26 at 11:59pm ET to Canvas.  For the software lab competitions, submissions will be judged on the basis of the following criteria: Strength and quality of final results (lab dependent) Soundness of implementation and approach Thoroughness and quality of provided descriptions and figures Gather.Town lab + Office Hour sessions After each day’s lecture, there will be open Office Hours in the class GatherTown, up until 3pm ET. An MIT email is required to log in and join the GatherTown. During these sessions, there will not be a walk through or dictation of the labs; the labs are designed to be self-paced and to be worked on on your own time.  The GatherTown sessions will be hosted by course staff and are held so you can: Ask questions on course lectures, labs, logistics, project, or anything else; Work on the labs in the presence of classmates/TAs/instructors; Meet classmates to find groups for the final project; Group work time for the final project; Bring the class community together. Final project To satisfy the final project requirement for this course, students will have two options: (1) write a 1 page paper review (single-spaced) on a recent deep learning paper of your choice or (2) participate and present in the project proposal pitch competition. The 1 page paper review option is straightforward, we propose some papers within this document to help you get started, and you can satisfy a passing grade with this option -- you will not be eligible for the grand prizes. On the other hand, participation in the project proposal pitch competition will equivalently satisfy your course requirements but additionally make you eligible for the grand prizes. See the section below for more details and requirements for each of these options. Paper Review Students may satisfy the final project requirement by reading and reviewing a recent deep learning paper of their choosing. In the written review, students should provide both: 1) a description of the problem, technical approach, and results of the paper; 2) critical analysis and exposition of the limitations of the work and opportunities for future work. Reviews should be submitted on Canvas by Thursday Jan 28, 2021, 11:59:59pm Eastern Time (ET).  Just a few paper options to consider...  https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/file/69386f6bb1dfed68692a24c8686939b9-Paper.pdf https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Paper.pdf https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6419/1140 https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/file/0e64a7b00c83e3d22ce6b3acf2c582b6-Paper.pdf https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11829.pdf https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00237-3 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32084340/ Project Proposal Presentation Keyword: proposal  This is a 2 week course so we do not require results or working implementations!

(see below)  Sign up to Present here: by 11:59pm ET on Wednesday Jan 27  Once you sign up, make your slide in the following Google Slides; submit by midnight on Thursday Jan 28. Please specify the project group # on your slides!!!  Things to Consider This doesn’t have to be a new deep learning method.  It can just be an interesting application that you apply some existing deep learning method to. What problem are you solving?  Are there use cases/applications?   Why do you think deep learning methods might be suited to this task?  How have people done it before? Is it a new task? If so, what are similar tasks that people have worked on?  In what aspects have they succeeded or failed?   What is your method of solving this problem? What type of model + architecture would you use?  Why?  What is the data for this task? Do you need to make a dataset or is there one publicly available? What are the characteristics of the data?  Is it sparse, messy, imbalanced?  How would you deal with that? Project Proposal Grading Rubric Project proposals will be evaluated by a panel of judges on the basis of the following three criteria: 1) novelty and impact; 2) technical soundness, feasibility, and organization, including quality of any presented results; 3) clarity and presentation. Each judge will award a score from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) for each of the criteria; the average score from each judge across these criteria will then be averaged with that of the other judges to provide the final score. The proposals with the highest final scores will be selected for prizes.   Here are the guidelines for the criteria:  Novelty and impact: encompasses the potential impact of the project idea, its novelty with respect to existing approaches. Why does the proposed work matter? What problem(s) does it solve? Why are these problems important? Technical soundness, feasibility, and organization: encompasses all technical aspects of the proposal. Do the proposed methodology and architecture make sense? Is the architecture the best suited for the proposed problem? Is deep learning the best approach for the problem? How realistic is it to implement the idea? Was there any implementation of the method? If results and data are presented, we will evaluate the strength of the results/data. Clarity and presentation: encompasses the delivery and quality of the presentation itself. Is the talk well organized? Are the slides aesthetically compelling? Is there a clear, well-delivered narrative? Are the problem and proposed method clearly presented?   Past Project Proposal Ideas Recipe Generation with RNNs Can we compress videos with CNN + RNN? Music Generation with RNNs Style Transfer Applied to X GAN’s on a new modality Summarizing text/news articles Combining news articles about similar events  Code or spec generation Multimodal speech → handwriting Generate handwriting based on keywords (i.e. cursive, slanted, neat) Predicting stock market trends Show language learners articles or videos at their level  Transfer of writing style Chemical Synthesis with Recurrent Neural networks Transfer learning to learn something in a domain for which it’s hard or risky to gather data or do training RNNs to model some type of time series data Computer vision to coach sports players Computer vision system for safety brakes or warnings  Use IBM Watson API to get the sentiment of your Facebook newsfeed Deep learning webcam to give wifi-access to friends or improve video chat in some way Domain-specific chatbot to help you perform a specific task Detect whether a signature is fraudulent Awards + Categories Final Project Awards: 1x NVIDIA RTX 3080 4x Google Home Max 3x Display Monitors  Software Lab Awards: Bose headphones (Lab 1) Display monitor (Lab 2) Bebop drone (Lab 3) Important Links and Emails Course website: http://introtodeeplearning.com Course staff: introtodeeplearning-staff@mit.edu Piazza forum (MIT only): https://piazza.com/mit/spring2021/6s191 Canvas (MIT only): https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/8291 Software lab repository: https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning Lab/office hour sessions (MIT only): https://gather.town/app/56toTnlBrsKCyFgj/MITDeepLearning",https://api.github.com/repos/ankurhcu/6S191_MIT_DeepLearning/commits,0,0,1,2022-09-23T06:04:42Z,2022-09-23T06:04:37Z

Anti-Virus-Evading-Payloads,"During the exploitation phase of a pen test or ethical hacking engagement, you will ultimately need to try to cause code to run on target system computers. Whether accomplished by phishing emails, delivering a payload through an exploit, or social engineering, running code on target computers is part of most penetration tests. That means that you will need to be able to bypass antivirus software or other host-based protection for successful exploitation. The most effective way to avoid antivirus detection on your target's computers is to create your own customized backdoor.

Adaptive-Filter,"An adaptive filter was designed that can update its weights according to the application needed (lowpass, highpass or bandpass) using the Delayed Least Mean Squared Algorithm. Concepts of VLSI and Digital Design such as Carry Save Addition, Fixed Point Arithmetic, Offset Binary Coding, Distributed Arithmetic and Low power optimization techniques were incorporated. Three models were proposed which excel in particular aspects such as throughput, delay, area and power. Better throughput was achieved compared to an existing design for an Order-4 Filter. The architecture required to store the pre computed values of weight combinations in a Look Up Table was greatly reduced due to the implementation of Offset Binary Coding. Proposed design was coded and verified in Verilog HDL.",https://api.github.com/repos/ahn-github/Adaptive-Filter/commits,1,0,1,2019-09-18T12:15:17Z,2019-09-18T12:17:28Z

padding_free_matrix_transpose_gpu,"The advances of Graphic Processing Units (GPU) technology and the introduction of CUDA programming model facilitates developing new solutions for sparse and dense linear algebra solvers. Matrix Transpose is an important linear algebra procedure that has deep impact in various computational science and engineering applications. Several factors hinder the expected performance of large matrix transpose on GPU devices. The degradation in performance involves the memory access pattern such as coalesced access in the global memory and bank conflict in the shared memory of streaming multiprocessors within the GPU. In this paper, two matrix transpose algorithms are proposed to alleviate the aforementioned issues of ensuring coalesced access and conflict free bank access. The proposed algorithms have comparable execution times with the NVIDIA SDK bank conflict - free matrix transpose implementation. The main advantage of proposed algorithms is that they eliminate bank conflicts while allocating shared memory exactly equal to the tile size (T x T) of the problem space. However, to the best of our knowledge an extra space of Tx(T+1) needs to be allocated in the published research. We have also applied the proposed transpose algorithm to recursive gaussian implementation of NVIDIA SDK and achieved about 6% improvement in performance.",https://api.github.com/repos/ayazhassan/padding_free_matrix_transpose_gpu/commits,0,1,0,2017-10-26T09:48:09Z,2018-06-06T07:53:50Z

RT-CUDA-GUI-Development,"Recent development in Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) has opened a new challenge in harnessing their computing power as a new general-purpose computing paradigm with its CUDA parallel programming. However, porting applications to CUDA remains a challenge to average programmers. We have developed a restructuring software compiler (RT-CUDA) with best possible kernel optimizations to bridge the gap between high-level languages and the machine dependent CUDA environment. RT-CUDA is based upon a set of compiler optimizations. RT-CUDA takes a C-like program and convert it into an optimized CUDA kernel with user directives in a con.figuration .file for guiding the compiler. While the invocation of external libraries is not possible with OpenACC commercial compiler, RT-CUDA allows transparent invocation of the most optimized external math libraries like cuSparse and cuBLAS. For this, RT-CUDA uses interfacing APIs, error handling interpretation, and user transparent programming. This enables efficient design of linear algebra solvers (LAS). Evaluation of RT-CUDA has been performed on Tesla K20c GPU with a variety of basic linear algebra operators (M+, MM, MV, VV, etc.) as well as the programming of solvers of systems of linear equations like Jacobi and Conjugate Gradient. We obtained significant speedup over other compilers like OpenACC and GPGPU compilers. RT-CUDA facilitates the design of efficient parallel software for developing parallel simulators (reservoir simulators, molecular dynamics, etc.) which are critical for Oil & Gas industry. We expect RT-CUDA to be needed by many industries dealing with science and engineering simulation on massively parallel computers like NVIDIA GPUs.",https://api.github.com/repos/ayazhassan/RT-CUDA-GUI-Development/commits,4,0,0,2018-02-28T03:59:25Z,2023-01-31T01:13:26Z

Labs, Final Projects, Grading, and Prizes Course will be graded during MIT IAP for 6 units under P/D/F grading. Receiving a passing grade requires completion of each software lab project (through honor code, with submission required to enter lab competitions), a final project proposal/presentation or written review of a deep learning paper (submission required), and attendance/lecture viewing (through honor code). Submission of a written report or presentation of a project proposal will ensure a passing grade.  MIT students will be eligible for prizes and awards as part of the class competitions. There will be two parts to the competitions: (1) software labs and (2) final projects. More information is provided below. Winners will be announced on the last day of class, with thousands of dollars of prizes being given away!  Software labs There are three TensorFlow software lab exercises for the course, designed as iPython notebooks hosted in Google Colab. Software labs can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning. These are self-paced exercises and are designed to help you gain practical experience implementing neural networks in TensorFlow.  For registered MIT students, submission of lab materials is not necessary to get credit for the course or to pass the course.  At the end of each software lab there will be task-associated materials to submit (along with instructions) for entry into the competitions, open to MIT students and affiliates during the IAP offering. This includes MIT students/affiliates who are taking the class as listeners -- you are eligible!  These instructions are provided at the end of each of the labs. Completing these tasks and submitting your materials to Canvas will enter you into a per-lab competition. MIT students and affiliates will be eligible for prizes during the IAP offering; at the end of the course, prize-winners will be awarded with their prizes.  All competition submissions are due on January 26 at 11:59pm ET to Canvas.  For the software lab competitions, submissions will be judged on the basis of the following criteria: Strength and quality of final results (lab dependent) Soundness of implementation and approach Thoroughness and quality of provided descriptions and figures Gather.Town lab + Office Hour sessions After each day’s lecture, there will be open Office Hours in the class GatherTown, up until 3pm ET. An MIT email is required to log in and join the GatherTown. During these sessions, there will not be a walk through or dictation of the labs; the labs are designed to be self-paced and to be worked on on your own time.  The GatherTown sessions will be hosted by course staff and are held so you can: Ask questions on course lectures, labs, logistics, project, or anything else; Work on the labs in the presence of classmates/TAs/instructors; Meet classmates to find groups for the final project; Group work time for the final project; Bring the class community together. Final project To satisfy the final project requirement for this course, students will have two options: (1) write a 1 page paper review (single-spaced) on a recent deep learning paper of your choice or (2) participate and present in the project proposal pitch competition. The 1 page paper review option is straightforward, we propose some papers within this document to help you get started, and you can satisfy a passing grade with this option -- you will not be eligible for the grand prizes. On the other hand, participation in the project proposal pitch competition will equivalently satisfy your course requirements but additionally make you eligible for the grand prizes. See the section below for more details and requirements for each of these options. Paper Review Students may satisfy the final project requirement by reading and reviewing a recent deep learning paper of their choosing. In the written review, students should provide both: 1) a description of the problem, technical approach, and results of the paper; 2) critical analysis and exposition of the limitations of the work and opportunities for future work. Reviews should be submitted on Canvas by Thursday Jan 28, 2021, 11:59:59pm Eastern Time (ET).  Just a few paper options to consider...  https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/file/69386f6bb1dfed68692a24c8686939b9-Paper.pdf https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Paper.pdf https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6419/1140 https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/file/0e64a7b00c83e3d22ce6b3acf2c582b6-Paper.pdf https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11829.pdf https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00237-3 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32084340/ Project Proposal Presentation Keyword: proposal  This is a 2 week course so we do not require results or working implementations! However, to win the top prizes, nice, clear results and implementations will demonstrate feasibility of your proposal which is something we look for!  Logistics -- please read!  You must sign up to present before 11:59:59pm Eastern Time (ET) on Wednesday Jan 27, 2021 Slides must be in a Google Slide before 11:59:59pm Eastern Time (ET) on Thursday Jan 28, 2021 Project groups can be between 1 and 5 people Listeners welcome To be eligible for a prize you must have at least 1 registered MIT student in your group Each participant will only be allowed to be in one group and present one project pitch Synchronous attendance on 1/29/21 is required to make the project pitch! 3 min presentation on your idea (we will be very strict with the time limits) Prizes! (see below)  Sign up to Present here: by 11:59pm ET on Wednesday Jan 27  Once you sign up, make your slide in the following Google Slides; submit by midnight on Thursday Jan 28. Please specify the project group # on your slides!!!  Things to Consider This doesn’t have to be a new deep learning method.  It can just be an interesting application that you apply some existing deep learning method to. What problem are you solving?  Are there use cases/applications?   Why do you think deep learning methods might be suited to this task?  How have people done it before? Is it a new task? If so, what are similar tasks that people have worked on?  In what aspects have they succeeded or failed?   What is your method of solving this problem? What type of model + architecture would you use?  Why?  What is the data for this task? Do you need to make a dataset or is there one publicly available? What are the characteristics of the data?  Is it sparse, messy, imbalanced?  How would you deal with that? Project Proposal Grading Rubric Project proposals will be evaluated by a panel of judges on the basis of the following three criteria: 1) novelty and impact; 2) technical soundness, feasibility, and organization, including quality of any presented results; 3) clarity and presentation. Each judge will award a score from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) for each of the criteria; the average score from each judge across these criteria will then be averaged with that of the other judges to provide the final score. The proposals with the highest final scores will be selected for prizes.   Here are the guidelines for the criteria:  Novelty and impact: encompasses the potential impact of the project idea, its novelty with respect to existing approaches. Why does the proposed work matter? What problem(s) does it solve? Why are these problems important? Technical soundness, feasibility, and organization: encompasses all technical aspects of the proposal. Do the proposed methodology and architecture make sense? Is the architecture the best suited for the proposed problem? Is deep learning the best approach for the problem? How realistic is it to implement the idea? Was there any implementation of the method? If results and data are presented, we will evaluate the strength of the results/data. Clarity and presentation: encompasses the delivery and quality of the presentation itself. Is the talk well organized? Are the slides aesthetically compelling? Is there a clear, well-delivered narrative? Are the problem and proposed method clearly presented?   Past Project Proposal Ideas Recipe Generation with RNNs Can we compress videos with CNN + RNN? Music Generation with RNNs Style Transfer Applied to X GAN’s on a new modality Summarizing text/news articles Combining news articles about similar events  Code or spec generation Multimodal speech → handwriting Generate handwriting based on keywords (i.e. cursive, slanted, neat) Predicting stock market trends Show language learners articles or videos at their level  Transfer of writing style Chemical Synthesis with Recurrent Neural networks Transfer learning to learn something in a domain for which it’s hard or risky to gather data or do training RNNs to model some type of time series data Computer vision to coach sports players Computer vision system for safety brakes or warnings  Use IBM Watson API to get the sentiment of your Facebook newsfeed Deep learning webcam to give wifi-access to friends or improve video chat in some way Domain-specific chatbot to help you perform a specific task Detect whether a signature is fraudulent Awards + Categories Final Project Awards: 1x NVIDIA RTX 3080 4x Google Home Max 3x Display Monitors  Software Lab Awards: Bose headphones (Lab 1) Display monitor (Lab 2) Bebop drone (Lab 3) Important Links and Emails Course website: http://introtodeeplearning.com Course staff: introtodeeplearning-staff@mit.edu Piazza forum (MIT only): https://piazza.com/mit/spring2021/6s191 Canvas (MIT only): https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/8291 Software lab repository: https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning Lab/office hour sessions (MIT only): https://gather.town/app/56toTnlBrsKCyFgj/MITDeepLearning",https://api.github.com/repos/BillyGareth/6S191_MIT_DeepLearning/commits,0,0,1,2022-08-19T06:10:42Z,2022-08-16T17:36:41Z

HandsOn-Data-Analysis-and-ML,"Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.  Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.  In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.   Day:1  In this project, Students will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. They will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics. Technologies that will be covered are Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter notebook. We will be giving the students a deep dive into the Data Analytical process   Day:2  We will be giving the students an insight into one of the major fields of Machine Learning ie. Time Series forcasting we will be taking them through the relevant theory and make them understand of the importance and different techniques that are available to deal with it. After that we will be working hands on the bike share data set implementing different algorithms and understanding them to the core    We aim to provide students an insight into what exactly is the job of a data analyst and get them familiarise to how does the entire data analysis process work.  The session will be hosted by Shaurya Sinha a data analyst at Jio and Parag Mittal Software engineer at Microsoft.",https://api.github.com/repos/Dhiraj1107/HandsOn-Data-Analysis-and-ML/commits,0,0,1,2021-05-28T21:46:07Z,2021-05-28T21:46:08Z

Assemblies-of-putative-SARS-CoV2-spike-encoding-mRNA-sequences-for-vaccines-BNT-162b2-and-mRNA-1273,"RNA vaccines have become a key tool in moving forward through the challenges raised both in the current pandemic and in numerous other public health and medical challenges.  With the rollout of vaccines for COVID-19, these synthetic mRNAs have become broadly distributed RNA species in numerous human populations.  Despite their ubiquity, sequences are not always available for such RNAs.  Standard methods facilitate such sequencing.  In this note, we provide experimental sequence information for the RNA components of the initial Moderna (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32756549/) and Pfizer/BioNTech (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33301246/) COVID-19 vaccines, allowing a working assembly of the former and a confirmation of previously reported sequence information for the latter RNA.  Sharing of sequence information for broadly used therapeutics has the benefit of allowing any researchers or clinicians using sequencing approaches to rapidly identify such sequences as therapeutic-derived rather than host or infectious in origin.   For this work, RNAs were obtained as discards from the small portions of vaccine doses that remained in vials after immunization; such portions would have been required to be otherwise discarded and were analyzed under FDA authorization for research use.  To obtain the small amounts of RNA needed for characterization, vaccine remnants were phenol-chloroform extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), with intactness assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer before and after extraction.    Although our analysis mainly focused on RNAs obtained as soon as possible following discard, we also analyzed samples which had been refrigerated (~4 ℃) for up to 42 days with and without the addition of EDTA.  Interestingly a substantial fraction of the RNA remained intact in these preparations.  We note that the formulation of the vaccines includes numerous key chemical components which are quite possibly unstable under these conditions-- so these data certainly do not suggest that the vaccine as a biological agent is stable.  But it is of interest that chemical stability of RNA itself is not sufficient to preclude eventual development of vaccines with a much less involved cold-chain storage and transportation.   For further analysis, the initial RNAs were fragmented by heating to 94℃, primed with a random hexamer-tailed adaptor, amplified through a template-switch protocol (Takara SMARTerer Stranded RNA-seq kit), and sequenced using a MiSeq instrument (Illumina) with paired end 78-per end sequencing.  As a reference material in specific assays, we included RNA of known concentration and sequence (from bacteriophage MS2).  From these data, we obtained partial information on strandedness and a set of segments that could be used for assembly.  This was particularly useful for the Moderna vaccine, for which the original vaccine RNA sequence was not available at the time our study was carried out.  Contigs encoding full-length spikes were assembled from the Moderna and Pfizer datasets.  The Pfizer/BioNTech data [Figure 1] verified the reported sequence for that vaccine (https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/), while the Moderna sequence [Figure 2] could not be checked against a published reference.   RNA preparations lacking dsRNA are desirable in generating vaccine formulations as these will minimize an otherwise dramatic biological (and nonspecific) response that vertebrates have to double stranded character in RNA (https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243).  In the sequence data that we analyzed, we found that the vast majority of reads were from the expected sense strand.  In addition, the minority of antisense reads appeared different from sense reads in lacking the characteristic extensions expected from the template switching protocol.  Examining only the reads with an evident template switch (as an indicator for strand-of-origin), we observed that both vaccines overwhelmingly yielded sense reads (>99.99%).  Independent sequencing assays and other experimental measurements are ongoing and will be needed to determine whether this template-switched sense read fraction in the SmarterSeq protocol indeed represents the actual dsRNA content in the original material.  This work provides an initial assessment of two RNAs that are now a part of the human ecosystem and that are likely to appear in numerous other high throughput RNA-seq studies in which a fraction of the individuals may have previously been vaccinated.  ProtoAcknowledgements: Thanks to our colleagues for help and suggestions (Nimit Jain, Emily Greenwald, Lamia Wahba, William Wang, Amisha Kumar, Sameer Sundrani, David Lipman, Bijoyita Roy).  Figure 1: Spike-encoding contig assembled from BioNTech/Pfizer BNT-162b2 vaccine.  Although the full coding region is included, the nature of the methodology used for sequencing and assembly is such that the assembled contig could lack some sequence from the ends of the RNA.  Within the assembled sequence, this hypothetical sequence shows a perfect match to the corresponding sequence from documents available online derived from manufacturer communications with the World Health Organization [as reported by https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/].  The 5’ end for the assembly matches the start site noted in these documents, while the read-based assembly lacks an interrupted polyA tail (A30(GCATATGACT)A70) that is expected to be present in the mRNA.

3DLine-SLAM,"  3DLines-SLAM: A Monocular Vision Semi-Dense 3D Reconstruction Based on ORB-SLAM  Abstract-Producing high-quality 3D maps and calculating more accurate camera pose has always been the goal of SLAM technology. The requirements of SLAM technology such as real-time, low computational cost, and low hardware cost are contradictory to the above objectives. For the issues listed above, we propose a novel semi-dense reconstruction algorithm based on the monocular ORB-SLAM system by matching the line segment features extracted from keyframes. Specifically, we build upon ORB-SLAM, the system first provides a set of keyframes and their corresponding camera poses and a series of map points in real-time. Then we use our developed a keyframe re-culling algorithm to culling redundant keyframes. Then an improved line segment extraction method is used to extract line segments in each keyframe. Finally, we use purely geometric constraints to generates accurate 3D scene model by matching 2D line segments from different keyframes. We thoroughly evaluate and in-depth analysis of our approach, the results show our system runs steadily and reliably. Not only the whole system has strong robustness, but also it can quickly generate an accurate 3d model online with low computational costs.",https://api.github.com/repos/FENGZHANG123/3DLine-SLAM/commits,0,0,1,2021-12-07T13:41:59Z,2021-12-07T13:42:00Z
