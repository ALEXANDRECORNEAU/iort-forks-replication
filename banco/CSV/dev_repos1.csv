A-Simple-Chatbot-,"A chatbot (also known as a talkbot, chatterbot, Bot, IM bot, interactive agent, or Artificial Conversational Entity)The classic historic early chatbots are ELIZA (1966) and PARRY (1972).More recent notable programs include A.L.I.C.E., Jabberwacky and D.U.D.E (Agence Nationale de la Recherche and CNRS 2006). While ELIZA and PARRY were used exclusively to simulate typed conversation, many chatbots now include functional features such as games and web searching abilities. In 1984, a book called The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed was published, allegedly written by the chatbot Racter (though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so).  One pertinent field of AI research is natural language processing. Usually, weak AI fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required. For example, A.L.I.C.E. uses a markup language called AIML, which is specific to its function as a conversational agent, and has since been adopted by various other developers of, so called, Alicebots. Nevertheless, A.L.I.C.E. is still purely based on pattern matching techniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique ELIZA was using back in 1966. This is not strong AI, which would require sapience and logical reasoning abilities.  Jabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real-time user interactions, rather than being driven from a static database. Some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning with evolutionary algorithms that optimise their ability to communicate based on each conversation held. Still, there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence, and some software developers focus on the practical aspect, information retrieval.  Chatbot competitions focus on the Turing test or more specific goals. Two such annual contests are the Loebner Prize and The Chatterbox Challenge (offline since 2015, materials can still be found from web archives).  According to Forrester (2015), AI will replace 16 percent of American jobs by the end of the decade.Chatbots have been used in applications such as customer service, sales and product education. However, a study conducted by Narrative Science in 2015 found that 80 percent of their respondents believe AI improves worker performance and creates jobs.[citation needed] is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some chatterbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simpler systems scan for keywords within the input, then pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a database.  The term ""ChatterBot"" was originally coined by Michael Mauldin (creator of the first Verbot, Julia) in 1994 to describe these conversational programs.Today, most chatbots are either accessed via virtual assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, via messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger or WeChat, or via individual organizations' apps and websites. Chatbots can be classified into usage categories such as conversational commerce (e-commerce via chat), analytics, communication, customer support, design, developer tools, education, entertainment, finance, food, games, health, HR, marketing, news, personal, productivity, shopping, social, sports, travel and utilities.

Resume-Job-Description-Matching,The purpose of this project was to defeat the current Application Tracking System used by most of the organization to filter out resumes. In order to achieve this goal I had to come up with a universal score which can help the applicant understand the current status of the match.  The following steps were undertaken for this project 1) Job Descriptions were collected from Glass Door Web Site using Selenium as other scrappers failed 2) PDF resume parsing using PDF Miner 3) Creating a vector representation of each Job Description - Used word2Vec to create the vector in 300-dimensional vector space with each document represented as a list of word vectors 4) Given each word its required weights to counter few Job Description specific words to be dealt with - Used TFIDF score to get the word weights. 5) Important skill related words were given higher weights and overall mean of each Job description was obtained using the product for word vector and its TFIDF scores 6) Cosine Similarity was used get the similarities of the Job Description and the Resume 7) Various Natural Language Processing Techniques were identified to suggest on the improvements in the resume that could help increase the match score,https://api.github.com/repos/ats-hq/Resume-Job-Description-Matching/commits,0,0,1,2020-12-02T13:42:58Z,2020-12-02T13:43:00Z

Packages have attributes like item names, weight, size. Orders contain information of order number, date sent and received, number of packages, shipping address. Companies have unique name and address.  Using database allows multiple users to modify their own order information. There are two kinds of users in our application, customers and employees. Employees can check customers’ information, receive information, update order status, as well as send notification to customers. Customers are able to order and receive a delivery, change their personal information, track packages, request a specific date of delivery, etc. This project will be done using CS department’s oracle database and java, JDBC.

Android-Global-Parcelable,"Serialization in Java was far too slow for Android, so they created the Parcelable class that android developers use to serialize data.  The Parcelable approach requires that you explicitly serialize the members of your class, but in the end, you get a much faster serialization of your objects. The problem is you have to do this with every class you create.  In a large project with many classes with many objects this becomes tedious violating the rules of code reusability.  The solution is to create the Global Parcelable class that all other classes can extend.

-,定位综述 目前用于人脸定位的有两种主流方法，一种是基于级联形状回归模型，另一种就是基于深度学习的方法。级联形状回归方法就是使用回归模型，直接学习从人脸表征到人脸形状的映射函数，进而建立从表观到形状的对应关系。这种方法的学习依赖于训练集的选取，如果训练集中包含了复杂的姿态变化，学习到的函数测试性能就会比较好。现有很多基于回归的方法，其中比较突出的有颜水成的DCR（Deep Cascaded Regression）、ESR（Explicitly Shape Regression）方法、LBF（Local Binary Features）方法以及SDM（Supervised Decent Method）方法。但是，上述方法也存在一定的问题，例如，基于提取到的局部图像特征来定位时很难找到具有全局信息的关键点。基于点分布模型的方法和基于形状回归的方法都很依赖于初始值，其中，初始值通常由训练集的平均形状来给定，如果初始值或者设定的平均形状远远偏离目标位置，很难收敛到正确位置。比如，训练集中大部分都是正脸，那么对于测试集中大偏转角度人脸图像的定位就比较困难。 于是引入深度学习来解决较大面部偏转姿态的回归问题，深度学习的最大的优点是有强大的表达能力，可以自学习图像的特征，不需要人为的寻找特征。目前用的基本网络有（1）级联方式：由粗到精一级一级的优化前一步得到的形状，比如香港中文大学汤晓鸥老师的研究团队采用深度卷积神经网络的3个级联结构，逐步细化特征点位置。（2）沙漏网络：密集堆叠连接的U-Nets来进行人脸关键点定位，如CU-Nets通过卷积-反卷积，下采样与上采样网络，跨越不同U-Nets进行全局梯度传播，融合多尺度特征，不断迭代优化关键点坐标。但是深度学习方法的缺点是模型过于复杂，参数非常多，耗时比较长。 深度学习的国内外方法优化：（1）最早的有将人脸进行五官分区域定位回归，但很容易使最终结果陷入局部最优值而不是全局最优。（2）heatmap热图的方法，对数据标签进行处理生成高斯热图，从而更好的回归关键点位置。（3）风格聚合方法，对数据集进行处理生成不同风格的图片，以应对复杂的真实环境如光照强弱。（4）基于边缘感知的人脸关键点检测算法，首先通过消息传递并结合对抗学习得到高精度的边缘线检测结果，再将边缘线信息融合到关键点检测中，来提升算法在大侧脸、夸张表情、遮挡、模糊等极端情况下的鲁棒性。（5）3D人脸模型方法，一种方式是结合3D人脸姿态估计与投影来确定特征点初始位置，然后使用经典的回归树集成ERT方法来更好的进行位置回归；另一种是直接从单幅人脸图像中同时回归出3D人脸结构和密集对齐点；该类方法通过回归位置图，来获得3D几何以及语义信息。（6）人脸特征点检测与形状拟合方法，基于“特征提取”+“回归坐标”的方法，把形状拟合的坐标回归问题，转化为坐标PCA压缩后系数与形状整体仿射变换系数的回归问题（相当于将传统的SDM算法用于深度学习算法当中）。 目前定位方法的改进是： 1.基于深度学习的方法：改进如下： （1）受人体关键点定位 难例挖掘方法的启发，在全局的globalnet之后继续对损失较大的点继续进行微调。 （2）并行集成的方式同时训练两个网络globalnet、refinenet，测试时，第一个网络输出的l2 loss 取top k  loss作为refinenet的辅助损失继续微调回归关键点位置。（在300w 有缺失块的数据集上最终的测试结果，平均定位误差为5.9%）  300-W数据库： 68点定位库，包含4个数据集，比如AFW，LFPW，HELLE，还包含135张IBUG里面的图片，IBUG图片对于定位来说都是非常具有挑战性的，不管是旋转角度还是遮挡程度都是非常大的。我们用HELEN的2000张，LFPW的811张，AFW的337张，总共3148张图片作为训练集。用HELEN的554张，IBUG的135张图片，总共689张图片作为测试集。一般测试集分为3个标准：简单，有挑战，全集。简单的测试集就是前面554张图片，有挑战的就是后面那135张图片，全集即689张图片。对三个测试集分别测试，得出测试结果，并与其它方法进行比较。测试标准为定位的平均误差，是被双瞳孔距离归一化后的，平均误差越低代表这一算法越好。,https://api.github.com/repos/hhy5277/-/commits,0,0,1,2019-09-26T07:49:41Z,2019-09-26T07:49:43Z

dcm-imu,The DCM-IMU algorithm is designed for fusing low-cost triaxial MEMS gyroscope and accelerometer measurements. An extended Kalman filter is used to estimate attitude in direction cosine matrix (DCM) formation and gyroscope biases online. A variable measurement covariance method is implemented for acceleration measurements to ensure robustness against temporarily non-gravitational accelerations which usually induce errors to attitude estimate in ordinary IMU-algorithms.  The code and data will be added after related scientific work is published and open source publication is approved.,https://api.github.com/repos/roger-zhao/dcm-imu/commits,0,0,1,2017-07-25T10:11:57Z,2017-07-25T10:11:59Z

AARemu,"AARemu is a software tool enabling simulation of Augmented Reality    by allowing an AR developer to record a 360 degree view of a    location using the devices camera and orientation sensors (this    functionality is provided by the ARemRecorder app). The ARCamera    class which provides an impostor of the Android camera class    can then be used to preview the recorded scene instead of the live    camera preview provided by the Android Camera class. The ARCamera    preview callback is analogous to the standard Camera preview    callback except that the preview bytes provided in the callback    are extracted from a file created by the recorder application    based on the current bearing returned by the orientation    sensor(s). These preview bytes are passed to the development code    via the same preview callback as provided by the standard Camera    classes and can thus be processed by Computer Vision algorithms    before being displayed by the client application. The frames are    stored as individual video frames in RGBA, RGB or RGB565 format    and not as video so the preview can be accessed in both    clockwise and anti-clockwise directions.The tool is aimed at developers of outdoor mobile AR application    as it allows the developer to record one or more 360 degree    panoramas of a given location and then debug and test the AR    application in the comfort of a office or home without having to    make extensive changes to the programming    code.",https://api.github.com/repos/tazjel/AARemu/commits,0,0,1,2015-10-15T03:53:12Z,2017-08-26T07:15:35Z
