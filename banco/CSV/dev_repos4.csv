Cities3D,"Cities3D is a cross-platform implementation of the board game Settlers of Catan with all expansions, including Seafarers, and Cities & Knights.  It displays  the game world in 3 dimensions, with rotation, panning, and zooming, in bright  beautiful textures contributed to the project freely by talented individuals  from around the world.  The user interface is entirely custom drawn, with  crisp, clean lines and dozens of high-quality bitmaps to facilitate an  intuitive, pleasing experience for users.  Cities3D has an extensible plugin  architecture that allows new rules and variants to be added into the game  without changing an ounce of code in existing rules or variants.

-,定位综述 目前用于人脸定位的有两种主流方法，一种是基于级联形状回归模型，另一种就是基于深度学习的方法。级联形状回归方法就是使用回归模型，直接学习从人脸表征到人脸形状的映射函数，进而建立从表观到形状的对应关系。这种方法的学习依赖于训练集的选取，如果训练集中包含了复杂的姿态变化，学习到的函数测试性能就会比较好。现有很多基于回归的方法，其中比较突出的有颜水成的DCR（Deep Cascaded Regression）、ESR（Explicitly Shape Regression）方法、LBF（Local Binary Features）方法以及SDM（Supervised Decent Method）方法。但是，上述方法也存在一定的问题，例如，基于提取到的局部图像特征来定位时很难找到具有全局信息的关键点。基于点分布模型的方法和基于形状回归的方法都很依赖于初始值，其中，初始值通常由训练集的平均形状来给定，如果初始值或者设定的平均形状远远偏离目标位置，很难收敛到正确位置。比如，训练集中大部分都是正脸，那么对于测试集中大偏转角度人脸图像的定位就比较困难。 于是引入深度学习来解决较大面部偏转姿态的回归问题，深度学习的最大的优点是有强大的表达能力，可以自学习图像的特征，不需要人为的寻找特征。目前用的基本网络有（1）级联方式：由粗到精一级一级的优化前一步得到的形状，比如香港中文大学汤晓鸥老师的研究团队采用深度卷积神经网络的3个级联结构，逐步细化特征点位置。（2）沙漏网络：密集堆叠连接的U-Nets来进行人脸关键点定位，如CU-Nets通过卷积-反卷积，下采样与上采样网络，跨越不同U-Nets进行全局梯度传播，融合多尺度特征，不断迭代优化关键点坐标。但是深度学习方法的缺点是模型过于复杂，参数非常多，耗时比较长。 深度学习的国内外方法优化：（1）最早的有将人脸进行五官分区域定位回归，但很容易使最终结果陷入局部最优值而不是全局最优。（2）heatmap热图的方法，对数据标签进行处理生成高斯热图，从而更好的回归关键点位置。（3）风格聚合方法，对数据集进行处理生成不同风格的图片，以应对复杂的真实环境如光照强弱。（4）基于边缘感知的人脸关键点检测算法，首先通过消息传递并结合对抗学习得到高精度的边缘线检测结果，再将边缘线信息融合到关键点检测中，来提升算法在大侧脸、夸张表情、遮挡、模糊等极端情况下的鲁棒性。（5）3D人脸模型方法，一种方式是结合3D人脸姿态估计与投影来确定特征点初始位置，然后使用经典的回归树集成ERT方法来更好的进行位置回归；另一种是直接从单幅人脸图像中同时回归出3D人脸结构和密集对齐点；该类方法通过回归位置图，来获得3D几何以及语义信息。（6）人脸特征点检测与形状拟合方法，基于“特征提取”+“回归坐标”的方法，把形状拟合的坐标回归问题，转化为坐标PCA压缩后系数与形状整体仿射变换系数的回归问题（相当于将传统的SDM算法用于深度学习算法当中）。 目前定位方法的改进是： 1.基于深度学习的方法：改进如下： （1）受人体关键点定位 难例挖掘方法的启发，在全局的globalnet之后继续对损失较大的点继续进行微调。 （2）并行集成的方式同时训练两个网络globalnet、refinenet，测试时，第一个网络输出的l2 loss 取top k  loss作为refinenet的辅助损失继续微调回归关键点位置。（在300w 有缺失块的数据集上最终的测试结果，平均定位误差为5.9%）  300-W数据库： 68点定位库，包含4个数据集，比如AFW，LFPW，HELLE，还包含135张IBUG里面的图片，IBUG图片对于定位来说都是非常具有挑战性的，不管是旋转角度还是遮挡程度都是非常大的。我们用HELEN的2000张，LFPW的811张，AFW的337张，总共3148张图片作为训练集。用HELEN的554张，IBUG的135张图片，总共689张图片作为测试集。一般测试集分为3个标准：简单，有挑战，全集。简单的测试集就是前面554张图片，有挑战的就是后面那135张图片，全集即689张图片。对三个测试集分别测试，得出测试结果，并与其它方法进行比较。测试标准为定位的平均误差，是被双瞳孔距离归一化后的，平均误差越低代表这一算法越好。,https://api.github.com/repos/zhangwudisong/-/commits,0,0,1,2019-06-24T04:02:41Z,2019-06-24T04:02:43Z

We had modified existing tiny YOLO model for Indian vehicle such as auto rickshaw, bicycle, motorbikes etc. To do this, first we developed a data set of these vehicles then we retrained the existing tiny YOLO model. Moreover, with raspberry Pi we have developed a prototype for edge device which can count incoming and outgoing traffic from a particular point. There are various applications of such devices for example, it can be used as traffic monitoring system, surveillance, traffic load prediction. This is a fully functional independent device.

CmdrArduino,"CmdrArduino is an embedded library written in C++ that provides the foundation for implementing an NMRA DCC command station. CmdrArduino presents classes and methods for, among other things, setting a locomotive’s speed, activating functions, switching turnouts, and programming DCC decoders. CmdrArduino translates these commands into DCC packets. The packets are carefully prioritzed, and CmdrArduino keeps track of packets that require repeating in the background. An interrupt service routine attached to TIMER1 (AVR) or MCPWM0 (ARM) takes these packets and injects the highest priority packet into the precision DCC waveform. This signal is suitable for amplification with your favorite booster/power station (I like RAILbooster). Please note that the Arduino outputs are not themselves capable of driving trains directly.   Currently, CmdrArduino supports Arduino (including the Railstars Io;duino), with ARM support (for LPC17xx processors) actively being added, making the library name something of a misnomer.",https://api.github.com/repos/GaryMatthews/CmdrArduino/commits,0,0,1,2018-06-04T11:10:26Z,2018-06-04T11:10:27Z

hratc2017_expertinos_team,"The Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention is one of the world's most widely accepted treaties with 162 States Parties agreeing not to use, stockpile, produce or transfer antipersonnel mines. Although this has had profound impact worldwide, there is a non-negligible conflict legacy that still has provoked terrible consequences. According to the UN Mine Action Service, landmines kill 15,000-20,000 people every year (mostly children) and maim countless more across 78 countries. Demining efforts cost US$ 300-1000 per mine, and, for every 5000 mines cleared, one person is killed and two are injured. Thus, clearing post-combat regions of landmines has proven to be a difficult, risky, dangerous and expensive task with enormous social implications for civilians. Motivated by these considerations, the IEEE Robotics & Automation Society’s Special Interest Group on Humanitarian Technology (RAS–SIGHT) is inviting the academic and non-academic community to participate in the fourth Humanitarian Robotics and Automation Technology Challenge (HRATC) at the 2017 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA’17).   This fourth HRATC edition will follow the footsteps of previous ones and continue to focus on promoting the development of new strategies for autonomous landmine detection using a mobile (ground) robot. HRATC Challenge has three phases: 1) Simulation Phase, 2) Testing Phase, and 3) Finals Phase. The strategies developed by the participating teams will be according to the following criteria: exploration time and environmental coverage; detection and classification quality; and landmine avoidance. Teams will be progressively eliminated after each phase and the remaining teams would move on to the next phase culminating in the Challenge (Finals) phase at ICRA’17.

cvg_ardrone2_ibvs,"We present a vision based control strategy for tracking and following objects using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. We have developed an image based visual servoing method that uses only a forward looking camera for tracking and following objects from a multi-rotor UAV, without any dependence on GPS systems. Our proposed method tracks a user specified object continuously while maintaining a fixed distance from the object and also simultaneously keeping it in the center of the image plane. The algorithm is validated using a Parrot AR Drone 2.0 in outdoor conditions while tracking and following people, occlusions and also fast moving objects; showing the robustness of the proposed systems against perturbations and illumination changes. Our experiments show that the system is able to track a great variety of objects present in suburban areas, among others: people, windows, AC machines, cars and plants. urls: http://www.vision4uav.eu/?q=following and http://robotics.asu.edu/ardrone2_ibvs/ .",https://api.github.com/repos/ganwy2017/cvg_ardrone2_ibvs/commits,0,0,1,2018-05-07T04:53:06Z,2018-05-07T04:53:08Z

-L-,"W3C Strategic Highlights  September 2019  This report was prepared for the September 2019 W3C Advisory Committee Meeting (W3C Member link). See the accompanying W3C Fact Sheet — September 2019. For the previous edition, see the April 2019 W3C Strategic Highlights. For future editions of this report, please consult the latest version.  A Chinese translation is available.  ☰ Contents  Introduction Future Web Standards Meeting Industry Needs Web Payments Digital Publishing Media and Entertainment Web & Telecommunications Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) Web & Networks Automotive Web of Things Strengthening the Core of the Web HTML CSS Fonts SVG Audio Performance Web Performance WebAssembly Testing Browser Testing and Tools WebPlatform Tests Web of Data Web for All Security, Privacy, Identity Internationalization (i18n) Web Accessibility Outreach to the world W3C Developer Relations W3C Training Translations W3C Liaisons Introduction  This report highlights recent work of enhancement of the existing landscape of the Web platform and innovation for the growth and strength of the Web.  33 working groups and a dozen interest groups enable W3C to pursue its mission through the creation of Web standards, guidelines, and supporting materials. We track the tremendous work done across the Consortium through homogeneous work-spaces in Github which enables better monitoring and management.  We are in the middle of a period where we are chartering numerous working groups which demonstrate the rapid degree of change for the Web platform:  After 4 years, we are nearly ready to publish a Payment Request API Proposed Recommendation and we need to soon charter follow-on work. In the last year we chartered the Web Payment Security Interest Group. In the last year we chartered the Web Media Working Group with 7 specifications for next generation Media support on the Web. We have Accessibility Guidelines under W3C Member review which includes Silver, a new approach. We have just launched the Decentralized Identifier Working Group which has tremendous potential because Decentralized Identifier (DID) is an identifier that is globally unique, resolveable with high availability, and cryptographically verifiable. We have Privacy IG (PING) under W3C Member review which strengthens our focus on the tradeoff between privacy and function. We have a new CSS charter under W3C Member review which maps the group's work for the next three years. In this period, W3C and the WHATWG have succesfully completed the negotiation of a Memorandum of Understanding rooted in the mutual belief that that having two distinct specifications claiming to be normative is generally harmful for the Web community. The MOU, signed last May, describes how the two organizations are to collaborate on the development of a single authoritative version of the HTML and DOM specifications. W3C subsequently rechartered the HTML Working Group to assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and for the production of W3C Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts.  As the Web evolves continuously, some groups are looking for ways for specifications to do so as well. So-called ""evergreen recommendations"" or ""living standards"" aim to track continuous development (and maintenance) of features, on a feature-by-feature basis, while getting review and patent commitments.  We see the maturation and further development of an incredible number of new technologies coming to the Web. Continued progress in many areas demonstrates the vitality of the W3C and the Web community, as the rest of the report illustrates.  Future Web Standards W3C has a variety of mechanisms for listening to what the community thinks could become good future Web standards. These include discussions with the Membership, discussions with other standards bodies, the activities of thousands of participants in over 300 community groups, and W3C Workshops. There are lots of good ideas. The W3C strategy team has been identifying promising topics and invites public participation.   Future, recent and under consideration Workshops include:  Inclusive XR (5-6 November 2019, Seattle, WA, USA) to explore existing and future approaches on making Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences more inclusive, including to people with disabilities; W3C Workshop on Data Models for Transportation (12-13 September 2019, Palo Alto, CA, USA) W3C Workshop on Web Games (27-28 June 2019, Redmond, WA, USA), view report Second W3C Workshop on the Web of Things (3-5 June 2019, Munich, Germany) W3C Workshop on Web Standardization for Graph Data; Creating Bridges: RDF, Property Graph and SQL (4-6 March 2019, Berlin, Germany), view report Web & Machine Learning. The Strategy Funnel documents the staff's exploration of potential new work at various phases: Exploration and Investigation, Incubation and Evaluation, and eventually to the chartering of a new standards group. The Funnel view is a GitHub Project where new area are issues represented by “cards” which move through the columns, usually from left to right. Most cards start in Exploration and move towards Chartering, or move out of the funnel.  Public input is welcome at any stage but particularly once Incubation has begun. This helps W3C identify work that is sufficiently incubated to warrant standardization, to review the ecosystem around the work and indicate interest in participating in its standardization, and then to draft a charter that reflects an appropriate scope. Ongoing feedback can speed up the overall standardization process.  Since the previous highlights document, W3C has chartered a number of groups, and started discussion on many more:  Newly Chartered or Rechartered  Web Application Security WG (03-Apr) Web Payment Security IG (17-Apr) Patent and Standards IG (24-Apr) Web Applications WG (14-May) Web & Networks IG (16-May) Media WG (23-May) Media and Entertainment IG (06-Jun) HTML WG (06-Jun) Decentralized Identifier WG (05-Sep) Extended  Privacy IG (PING) (30-Sep) Verifiable Claims WG (30-Sep) Service Workers WG (31-Dec) Dataset Exchange WG (31-Dec) Web of Things Working Group (31-Dec) Web Audio Working Group (31-Dec) Proposed charters / Advance Notice  Accessibility Guidelines WG Privacy IG (PING) RDF Literal Direction WG Timed Text WG CSS WG Web Authentication WG Closed  Internationalization Tag Set IG Meeting Industry Needs Web Payments   All Web Payments specifications  W3C's payments standards enable a streamlined checkout experience, enabling a consistent user experience across the Web with lower front end development costs for merchants. Users can store and reuse information and more quickly and accurately complete online transactions.  The Web Payments Working Group has republished Payment Request API as a Candidate Recommendation, aiming to publish a Proposed Recommendation in the Fall 2019, and is discussing use cases and features for Payment Request after publication of the 1.0 Recommendation. Browser vendors have been finalizing implementation of features added in the past year (view the implementation report).  As work continues on the Payment Handler API and its implementation (currently in Chrome and Edge Canary), one focus in 2019 is to increase adoption in other browsers. Recently, Mastercard demonstrated the use of Payment Request API to carry out EMVCo's Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) protocol whose payment method definition is being developed with active participation by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. Payment method availability is a key factor in merchant considerations about adopting Payment Request API. The ability to get uniform adoption of a new payment method such as Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) also depends on the availability of the Payment Handler API in browsers, or of proprietary alternatives.  Web Monetization, which the Web Payments Working Group will discuss again at its face-to-face meeting in September, can be used to enable micropayments as an alternative revenue stream to advertising.  Since the beginning of 2019, Amazon, Brave Software, JCB, Certus Cybersecurity Solutions and Netflix have joined the Web Payments Working Group.  In April, W3C launched the Web Payment Security Group to enable W3C, EMVCo, and the FIDO Alliance to collaborate on a vision for Web payment security and interoperability. Participants will define areas of collaboration and identify gaps between existing technical specifications in order to increase compatibility among different technologies, such as:  How do SRC, FIDO, and Payment Request relate? The Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) regulations in Europe are scheduled to take effect in September 2019. What is the role of EMVCo, W3C, and FIDO technologies, and what is the current state of readiness for the deadline? How can we improve privacy on the Web at the same time as we meet industry requirements regarding user identity? Digital Publishing   All Digital Publishing specifications, Publication milestones  The Web is the universal publishing platform. Publishing is increasingly impacted by the Web, and the Web increasingly impacts Publishing.  Topic of particular interest to Publishing@W3C include typography and layout, accessibility, usability, portability, distribution, archiving, offline access, print on demand, and reliable cross referencing. And the diverse publishing community represented in the groups consist of the traditional ""trade"" publishers, ebook reading system manufacturers, but also publishers of audio book, scholarly journals or educational materials, library scientists or browser developers.  The Publishing Working Group currently concentrates on Audiobooks which lack a comprehensive standard, thus incurring extra costs and time to publish in this booming market. Active development is ongoing on the future standard:  Publication Manifest Audiobook profile for Web Publications Lightweight Packaging Format The BD Comics Manga Community Group, the Synchronized Multimedia for Publications Community Group, the Publishing Community Group and a future group on archival, are companions to the working group where specific work is developed and incubated.  The Publishing Community Group is a recently launched incubation channel for Publishing@W3C. The goal of the group is to propose, document, and prototype features broadly related to:  publications on the Web reading modes and systems and the user experience of publications The EPUB 3 Community Group has successfully completed the revision of EPUB 3.2.  The Publishing Business Group fosters ongoing participation by members of the publishing industry and the overall ecosystem in the development of Web infrastructure to better support the needs of the industry. The Business Group serves as an additional conduit to the Publishing Working Group and several Community Groups for feedback between the publishing ecosystem and W3C. The Publishing BG has played a vital role in fostering and advancing the adoption and continued development of EPUB 3. In particular the BG provided critical support to the update of EPUBCheck to validate EPUB content to the new EPUB 3.2 specification. This resulted in the development, in conjunction with the EPUB3 Community Group, of a new generation of EPUBCheck, i.e., EPUBCheck 4.2 production-ready release.  Media and Entertainment   All Media specifications  The Media and Entertainment vertical tracks media-related topics and features that create immersive experiences for end users. HTML5 brought standard audio and video elements to the Web. Standardization activities since then have aimed at turning the Web into a professional platform fully suitable for the delivery of media content and associated materials, enabling missing features to stream video content on the Web such as adaptive streaming and content protection. Together with Microsoft, Comcast, Netflix and Google, W3C received an Technology & Engineering Emmy Award in April 2019 for standardization of a full TV experience on the Web. Current goals are to:  Reinforce core media technologies: Creation of the Media Working Group, to develop media-related specifications incubated in the WICG (e.g. Media Capabilities, Picture-in-picture, Media Session) and maintain maintain/evolve Media Source Extensions (MSE) and Encrypted Media Extensions (EME). Improve support for Media Timed Events: data cues incubation. Enhance color support (HDR, wide gamut), in scope of the CSS WG and in the Color on the Web CG. Reduce fragmentation: Continue annual releases of a common and testable baseline media devices, in scope of the Web Media APIs CG and in collaboration with the CTA WAVE Project. Maintain the Road-map of Media Technologies for the Web which highlights Web technologies that can be used to build media applications and services, as well as known gaps to enable additional use cases. Create the future: Discuss perspectives for Media and Entertainment for the Web. Bring the power of GPUs to the Web (graphics, machine learning, heavy processing), under incubation in the GPU for the Web CG. Transition to a Working Group is under discussion. Determine next steps after the successful W3C Workshop on Web Games of June 2019. View the report. Timed Text  The Timed Text Working Group develops and maintains formats used for the representation of text synchronized with other timed media, like audio and video, and notably works on TTML, profiles of TTML, and WebVTT. Recent progress includes:  A robust WebVTT implementation report poises the specification for publication as a proposed recommendation. Discussions around re-chartering, notably to add a TTML Profile for Audio Description deliverable to the scope of the group, and clarify that rendering of captions within XR content is also in scope. Immersive Web  Hardware that enables Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications are now broadly available to consumers, offering an immersive computing platform with both new opportunities and challenges. The ability to interact directly with immersive hardware is critical to ensuring that the web is well equipped to operate as a first-class citizen in this environment.  The Immersive Web Working Group has been stabilizing the WebXR Device API while the companion Immersive Web Community Group incubates the next series of features identified as key for the future of the Immersive Web.  W3C plans a workshop focused on the needs and benefits at the intersection of VR & Accessibility (Inclusive XR), on 5-6 November 2019 in Seattle, WA, USA, to explore existing and future approaches on making Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences more inclusive.  Web & Telecommunications  The Web is the Open Platform for Mobile. Telecommunication service providers and network equipment providers have long been critical actors in the deployment of Web technologies. As the Web platform matures, it brings richer and richer capabilities to extend existing services to new users and devices, and propose new and innovative services.  Real-Time Communications (WebRTC)   All Real-Time Communications specifications  WebRTC has reshaped the whole communication landscape by making any connected device a potential communication end-point, bringing audio and video communications anywhere, on any network, vastly expanding the ability of operators to reach their customers. WebRTC serves as the corner-stone of many online communication and collaboration services.  The WebRTC Working Group aims to bringing WebRTC 1.0 (and companion specification Media Capture and Streams) to Recommendation by the end of 2019. Intense efforts are focused on testing (supported by a dedicated hackathon at IETF 104) and interoperability. The group is considering pushing features that have not gotten enough traction to separate modules or to a later minor revision of the spec.  Beyond WebRTC 1.0, the WebRTC Working Group will focus its efforts on WebRTC NV which the group has started documenting by identifying use cases.  Web & Networks  Recently launched, in the wake of the May 2018 Web5G workshop, the Web & Networks Interest Group is chaired by representatives from AT&T, China Mobile and Intel, with a goal to explore solutions for web applications to achieve better performance and resource allocation, both on the device and network. The group's first efforts are around use cases, privacy & security requirements and liaisons.  Automotive   All Automotive specifications  To create a rich application ecosystem for vehicles and other devices allowed to connect to the vehicle, the W3C Automotive Working Group is delivering a service specification to expose all common vehicle signals (engine temperature, fuel/charge level, range, tire pressure, speed, etc.)  The Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS), which is a Candidate Recommendation, is seeing more implementations across the industry. It provides the access method to a common data model for all the vehicle signals –presently encapsulating a thousand or so different data elements– and will be growing to accommodate the advances in automotive such as autonomous and driver assist technologies and electrification.  The group is already working on a successor to VISS, leveraging the underlying data model and the VIWI submission from Volkswagen, for a more robust means of accessing vehicle signals information and the same paradigm for other automotive needs including location-based services, media, notifications and caching content.  The Automotive and Web Platform Business Group acts as an incubator for prospective standards work. One of its task forces is using W3C VISS in performing data sampling and off-boarding the information to the cloud. Access to the wealth of information that W3C's auto signals standard exposes is of interest to regulators, urban planners, insurance companies, auto manufacturers, fleet managers and owners, service providers and others. In addition to components needed for data sampling and edge computing, capturing user and owner consent, information collection methods and handling of data are in scope.  The upcoming W3C Workshop on Data Models for Transportation (September 2019) is expected to focus on the need of additional ontologies around transportation space.  Web of Things   All Web of Things specifications  W3C's Web of Things work is designed to bridge disparate technology stacks to allow devices to work together and achieve scale, thus enabling the potential of the Internet of Things by eliminating fragmentation and fostering interoperability.  Thing descriptions expressed in JSON-LD cover the behavior, interaction affordances, data schema, security configuration, and protocol bindings. The Web of Things complements existing IoT ecosystems to reduce the cost and risk for suppliers and consumers of applications that create value by combining multiple devices and information services. There are many sectors that will benefit, e.g. smart homes, smart cities, smart industry, smart agriculture, smart healthcare and many more.  The Web of Things Working Group is finishing the initial Web of Things standards, with support from the Web of Things Interest Group:  Web of Things Architecture Thing Descriptions Strengthening the Core of the Web HTML   The HTML Working Group was chartered early June to assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and to produce W3C Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts.  A few days before, W3C and the WHATWG signed a Memorandum of Understanding outlining the agreement to collaborate on the development of a single version of the HTML and DOM specifications.  Issues and proposed solutions for HTML and DOM done via the newly rechartered HTML Working Group in the WHATWG repositories  The HTML Working Group is targetting November 2019 to bring HTML and DOM to Candidate Recommendations.  CSS  All CSS specifications  CSS is a critical part of the Open Web Platform. The CSS Working Group gathers requirements from two large groups of CSS users: the publishing industry and application developers. Within W3C, those groups are exemplified by the Publishing groups and the Web Platform Working Group. The former requires things like better pagination support and advanced font handling, the latter needs intelligent (and fast!) scrolling and animations.  What we know as CSS is actually a collection of almost a hundred specifications, referred to as ‘modules’. The current state of CSS is defined by a snapshot, updated once a year. The group also publishes an index defining every term defined by CSS specifications.  Fonts   All Fonts specifications  The Web Fonts Working Group develops specifications that allow the interoperable deployment of downloadable fonts on the Web, with a focus on Progressive Font Enrichment as well as maintenance of WOFF Recommendations.  Recent and ongoing work includes:  Early API experiments by Adobe and Monotype have demonstrated the feasibility of a font enrichment API, where a server delivers a font with minimal glyph repertoire and the client can query the full repertoire and request additional subsets on-the-fly. In other experiments, the Brotli compression used in WOFF 2 was extended to support shared dictionaries and patch update. Metrics to quantify improvement are a current hot discussion topic. The group will meet at ATypi 2019 in Japan, to gather requirements from the international typography community. The group will first produce a report summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of each prototype solution by Q2 2020. SVG   All SVG specifications  SVG is an important and widely-used part of the Open Web Platform. The SVG Working Group focuses on aligning the SVG 2.0 specification with browser implementations, having split the specification into a currently-implemented 2.0 and a forward-looking 2.1. Current activity is on stabilization, increased integration with the Open Web Platform, and test coverage analysis.  The Working Group was rechartered in March 2019. A new work item concerns native (non-Web-browser) uses of SVG as a non-interactive, vector graphics format.  Audio  The Web Audio Working Group was extended to finish its work on the Web Audio API, expecting to publish it as a Recommendation by year end. The specification enables synthesizing audio in the browser. Audio operations are performed with audio nodes, which are linked together to form a modular audio routing graph. Multiple sources — with different types of channel layout — are supported. This modular design provides the flexibility to create complex audio functions with dynamic effects.  The first version of Web Audio API is now feature complete and is implemented in all modern browsers. Work has started on the next version, and new features are being incubated in the Audio Community Group.  Performance   Web Performance  All Web Performance specifications  There are currently 18 specifications in development in the Web Performance Working Group aiming to provide methods to observe and improve aspects of application performance of user agent features and APIs. The W3C team is looking at related work incubated in the W3C GPU for the Web (WebGPU) Community Group which is poised to transition to a W3C Working Group. A preliminary draft charter is available.  WebAssembly  All WebAssembly specifications  WebAssembly improves Web performance and power by being a virtual machine and execution environment enabling loaded pages to run native (compiled) code. It is deployed in Firefox, Edge, Safari and Chrome. The specification will soon reach Candidate Recommendation.  WebAssembly enables near-native performance, optimized load time, and perhaps most importantly, a compilation target for existing code bases. While it has a small number of native types, much of the performance increase relative to Javascript derives from its use of consistent typing. WebAssembly leverages decades of optimization for compiled languages and the byte code is optimized for compactness and streaming (the web page starts executing while the rest of the code downloads). Network and API access all occurs through accompanying Javascript libraries -- the security model is identical to that of Javascript.  Requirements gathering and language development occur in the Community Group while the Working Group manages test development, community review and progression of specifications on the Recommendation Track.  Testing  Browser testing plays a critical role in the growth of the Web by:  Improving the reliability of Web technology definitions; Improving the quality of implementations of these technologies by helping vendors to detect bugs in their products; Improving the data available to Web developers on known bugs and deficiencies of Web technologies by publishing results of these tests. Browser Testing and Tools  The Browser Testing and Tools Working Group is developing WebDriver version 2, having published last year the W3C Recommendation of WebDriver. WebDriver acts as a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents, provides a platform- and language-neutral wire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the behavior of Web, and emulates the actions of a real person using the browser.  WebPlatform Tests   The WebPlatform Tests project now provides a mechanism which allows to fully automate tests that previously needed to be run manually: TestDriver.  TestDriver enables sending trusted key and mouse events, sending complex series of trusted pointer and key interactions for things like in-content drag-and-drop or pinch zoom, and even file upload.  Since 2014 W3C began work on this coordinated open-source effort to build a cross-browser test suite for the Web Platform, which WHATWG, and all major browsers adopted.  Web of Data   All Data specifications  There have been several great success stories around the standardization of data on the web over the past year.  Verifiable Claims seems to have significant uptake. It is also significant that the Distributed Identifier WG charter has received numerous favorable reviews, and was just recently launched. JSON-LD has been a major success with the large deployment on Web sites via schema.org.  JSON-LD 1.1 completed technical work, about to transition to CR More than 25% of websites today include schema.org data in JSON-LD The Web of Things description is in CR since May, making use of JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials data model is in CR since July, also making use of JSON-LD Continued strong interest in decentralized identifiers Engagement from the TAG with reframing core documents, such as Ethical Web Principles, to include data on the web within their scope Data is increasingly important for all organizations, especially with the rise of IoT and Big Data. W3C has a mature and extensive suite of standards relating to data that were developed over two decades of experience, with plans for further work on making it easier for developers to work with graph data and knowledge graphs.  Linked Data is about the use of URIs as names for things, the ability to dereference these URIs to get further information and to include links to other data. There are ever-increasing sources of open Linked Data on the Web, as well as data services that are restricted to the suppliers and consumers of those services.  The digital transformation of industry is seeking to exploit advanced digital technologies. This will facilitate businesses to integrate horizontally along the supply and value chains, and vertically from the factory floor to the office floor. W3C is seeking to make it easier to support enterprise-wide data management and governance, reflecting the strategic importance of data to modern businesses.  Traditional approaches to data have focused on tabular databases (SQL/RDBMS), Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, and data embedded in PDF documents and spreadsheets. We're now in midst of a major shift to graph data with nodes and labeled directed links between them. Graph data is:  Faster than using SQL and associated JOIN operations More favorable to integrating data from heterogeneous sources Better suited to situations where the data model is evolving In the wake of the recent W3C Workshop on Graph Data we are in the process of launching a Graph Standardization Business Group to provide a business perspective with use cases and requirements, to coordinate technical standards work and liaisons with external organizations.  Web for All Security, Privacy, Identity  All Security specifications, all Privacy specifications  Authentication on the Web   As the WebAuthn Level 1 W3C Recommendation published last March is seeing wide implementation and adoption of strong cryptographic authentication, work is proceeding on Level 2.  The open standard Web API gives native authentication technology built into native platforms, browsers, operating systems (including mobile) and hardware, offering protection against hacking, credential theft, phishing attacks, thus aiming to end the era of passwords as a security construct. You may read more in our March press release.  Privacy  An increasing number of W3C specifications are benefitting from Privacy and Security review; there are security and privacy aspects to every specification. Early review is essential. Working with the TAG, the Privacy Interest Group has updated the Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy.  Other recent work of the group includes public blogging further to the exploration of anti-patterns in standards and permission prompts.  Security  The Web Application Security Working Group adopted Feature Policy, aiming to allow developers to selectively enable, disable, or modify the behavior of some of these browser features and APIs within their application; and Fetch Metadata, aiming to provide servers with enough information to make a priori decisions about whether or not to service a request based on the way it was made, and the context in which it will be used.  The Web Payment Security Interest Group, launched last April, convenes members from W3C, EMVCo, and the FIDO Alliance to discuss cooperative work to enhance the security and interoperability of Web payments (read more about payments).  Internationalization (i18n)   All Internationalization specifications, educational articles related to Internationalization, spec developers checklist  Only a quarter or so current Web users use English online and that proportion will continue to decrease as the Web reaches more and more communities of limited English proficiency. If the Web is to live up to the ""World Wide"" portion of its name, and for the Web to truly work for stakeholders all around the world engaging with content in various languages, it must support the needs of worldwide users as they engage with content in the various languages. The growth of epublishing also brings requirements for new features and improved typography on the Web. It is important to ensure the needs of local communities are captured.  The W3C Internationalization Initiative was set up to increase in-house resources dedicated to accelerating progress in making the World Wide Web ""worldwide"" by gathering user requirements, supporting developers, and education & outreach.  For an overview of current projects see the i18n radar. W3C's Internationalization efforts progressed on a number of fronts recently:  Requirements: New African and European language groups will work on the gap analysis, errata and layout requirements. Gap analysis: Japanese, Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, Lao, Khmer, Javanese, and Ethiopic updated in the gap-analysis documents. Layout requirements document: notable progress tracked in the Southeast Asian Task Force while work continues on Chinese layout requirements. Developer support: Spec reviews: the i18n WG continues active review of specifications of the WHATWG and other W3C Working Groups. Short review checklist: easy way to begin a self-review to help spec developers understand what aspects of their spec are likely to need attention for internationalization, and points them to more detailed checklists for the relevant topics. It also helps those reviewing specs for i18n issues. Strings on the Web: Language and Direction Metadata lays out issues and discusses potential solutions for passing information about language and direction with strings in JSON or other data formats. The document was rewritten for clarity, and expanded. The group is collaborating with the JSON-LD and Web Publishing groups to develop a plan for updating RDF, JSON-LD and related specifications to handle metadata for base direction of text (bidi). User-friendly test format: a new format was developed for Internationalization Test Suite tests, which displays helpful information about how the test works. This particularly useful because those tests are pointed to by educational materials and gap-analysis documents. Web Platform Tests: a large number of tests in the i18n test suite have been ported to the WPT repository, including: css-counter-styles, css-ruby, css-syntax, css-test, css-text-decor, css-writing-modes, and css-pseudo. Education & outreach: (for all educational materials, see the HTML & CSS Authoring Techniques) Web Accessibility   All Accessibility specifications, WAI resources  The Web Accessibility Initiative supports W3C's Web for All mission. Recent achievements include:  Education and training: Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA updated to bring our analysis and recommendations up to date with CAPTCHA practice today, concluding two years of extensive work and invaluable input from the public (read more on the W3C Blog Learn why your web content and applications should be accessible. The Education and Outreach Working Group has completed revision and updating of the Business Case for Digital Accessibility. Accessibility guidelines: The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group has continued to update WCAG Techniques and Understanding WCAG 2.1; and published a Candidate Recommendation of Accessibility Conformance Testing Rules Format 1.0 to improve inter-rater reliability when evaluating conformance of web content to WCAG An updated charter is being developed to host work on ""Silver"", the next generation accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.2) There are accessibility aspects to most specifications. Check your work with the FAST checklist.  Outreach to the world W3C Developer Relations   To foster the excellent feedback loop between Web Standards development and Web developers, and to grow participation from that diverse community, recent W3C Developer Relations activities include:  @w3cdevs tracks the enormous amount of work happening across W3C W3C Track during the Web Conference 2019 in San Francisco Tech videos: W3C published the 2019 Web Games Workshop videos The 16 September 2019 Developer Meetup in Fukuoka, Japan, is open to all and will combine a set of technical demos prepared by W3C groups, and a series of talks on a selected set of W3C technologies and projects W3C is involved with Mozilla, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Bocoup in the organization of ViewSource 2019 in Amsterdam (read more on the W3C Blog) W3C Training   In partnership with EdX, W3C's MOOC training program, W3Cx offers a complete ""Front-End Web Developer"" (FEWD) professional certificate program that consists of a suite of five courses on the foundational languages that power the Web: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. We count nearly 900K students from all over the world.  Translations  Many Web users rely on translations of documents developed at W3C whose official language is English. W3C is extremely grateful to the continuous efforts of its community in ensuring our various deliverables in general, and in our specifications in particular, are made available in other languages, for free, ensuring their exposure to a much more diverse set of readers.  Last Spring we developed a more robust system, a new listing of translations of W3C specifications and updated the instructions on how to contribute to our translation efforts.  W3C Liaisons   Liaisons and coordination with numerous organizations and Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) is crucial for W3C to:  make sure standards are interoperable coordinate our respective agenda in Internet governance: W3C participates in ICANN, GIPO, IGF, the I* organizations (ICANN, IETF, ISOC, IAB). ensure at the government liaison level that our standards work is officially recognized when important to our membership so that products based on them (often done by our members) are part of procurement orders. W3C has ARO/PAS status with ISO. W3C participates in the EU MSP and Rolling Plan on Standardization ensure the global set of Web and Internet standards form a compatible stack of technologies, at the technical and policy level (patent regime, fragmentation, use in policy making) promote Standards adoption equally by the industry, the public sector, and the public at large Coralie Mercier, Editor, W3C Marketing & Communications $Id: Overview.html,v 1.60 2019/10/15 12:05:52 coralie Exp $ Copyright © 2019 W3C ® (MIT, ERCIM, Keio, Beihang) Usage policies apply.",https://api.github.com/repos/hixio-mh/-L-/commits,0,0,1,2021-12-24T19:46:35Z,2021-12-24T19:46:37Z

dimple,"This project is an implementation of a physical dynamics environment which can be controlled via OSC, so that audio projects such as PureData can create physical objects in a virtual space, and then let them interact with each other, colliding and otherwise moving around. Data about objects' position and acceleration, for example, can be retrieved and then used to affect some sort of audio synthesis.

For faster skin detection process we are using the imutils function to reisize the frame. The frames from the webcam are in bgr color space so we need to convert it into hsv color space.

AlexNet_TensorFlow2.0-2.2,"I am pleased to update the AlexNet and its variants to adapt to TensorFlow 2.0/2.1/2.2. Since the original script of myalexnet_forward written by the AlexNet team was build on TensorFlow 1.x in 2017, it has generated many errors during the runtime in the env. of TensorFlow 2.x. Either the AlexNet team has no time to update, or it is very hard for developers to find out the AlexNet variants to adapt to TensorFlow 2.0/2.1/2.2 with the Google search. Furthermore, I split the AlexNet model in both the OOP and the pure command style and make client applications to call the AlexNet model because the AlexNet model is not separated in most of the published scenarios which incur the difficulties for developer's deep learning. Considering that AlexNet is the greatest milestone in the CNNN/DNN history (Mr. Hinton has just won the Turing Award in 2019 and the event is not far from fading away), it is important to continue its usability and accessibility to all developers. It is exciting for me to take the opportunity to share the new update.",https://api.github.com/repos/vxgu86/AlexNet_TensorFlow2.0-2.2/commits,0,0,1,2021-03-09T17:20:45Z,2021-03-09T17:20:47Z

3DLine-SLAM,"  3DLines-SLAM: A Monocular Vision Semi-Dense 3D Reconstruction Based on ORB-SLAM  Abstract-Producing high-quality 3D maps and calculating more accurate camera pose has always been the goal of SLAM technology. The requirements of SLAM technology such as real-time, low computational cost, and low hardware cost are contradictory to the above objectives. For the issues listed above, we propose a novel semi-dense reconstruction algorithm based on the monocular ORB-SLAM system by matching the line segment features extracted from keyframes. Specifically, we build upon ORB-SLAM, the system first provides a set of keyframes and their corresponding camera poses and a series of map points in real-time. Then we use our developed a keyframe re-culling algorithm to culling redundant keyframes. Then an improved line segment extraction method is used to extract line segments in each keyframe. Finally, we use purely geometric constraints to generates accurate 3D scene model by matching 2D line segments from different keyframes. We thoroughly evaluate and in-depth analysis of our approach, the results show our system runs steadily and reliably. Not only the whole system has strong robustness, but also it can quickly generate an accurate 3d model online with low computational costs.",https://api.github.com/repos/YangZhengShi/3DLine-SLAM/commits,0,0,1,2021-09-01T05:31:12Z,2021-09-01T05:31:13Z

ANT-Automated-Nutrient-Technique,"UCI Senior Design Project: ANT. ANT is an attempt at building an automated hydroponic system using Nutrition Film Technique(NTF). NTF technique is chosen over other hydroponic technique in this system, because of low resource consumption (water and nutrient) in this hydroponic method and constant flow of water meaning no still water, thus, less disease/fungi can develop or grow.  This system will include environmental sensors (PH, EC, temperature, … etc.) in which data from these sensors will subsequently activated certain automation like automated fertilizer dosing under certain conditions (ie. low EC readings). Example of another automation this system would include will be auto ph balancing where ph down or ph up will be dosed when the ph sensor readings are out of the desired range.",https://api.github.com/repos/charithmadhuranga/ANT-Automated-Nutrient-Technique/commits,1,0,1,2022-01-18T21:09:17Z,2023-02-05T16:27:36Z

Angular-Directive-Project,"Angular-Directive-Project Directives range from very basic to extremely complex. This project will build up to some somewhat difficult directives. Keep in mind that the format we're learning for directives is the same format used to build some extremely complex things in angular. Using directives often and well is one way to show you're a talented developer.  Starting Out  We've included only a few things for you to begin with. index.html, app.js, styles.css. At this point the best way to get more comfortable with angular is to initialize an app without relying heavily on boilerplate code (reusable code that starts out your projects for you).  You'll notice that in the index.html we've included the angular-route CDN. Yes, we'll be using angular's router here. Put an ng-view into your index.html.  In your app.js set up a config and set up our first route for when a user is at the '/home' url. If you're having trouble remembering how to set up the router go look at how you set up the router on the previous project. One way these projects will be beneficial to you is allowing you to look back at something *you** did and seeing how you got that something to work.* You may also want add an otherwise that defaults to /home. Create a controller and a template file for this route in your app folder. Don't forget to include the controller as a script in your index.html Check that everything is hooked up correctly. Try adding a div with some text in your home template just to make sure it's showing up. Once you've got that going you're ready to start on some directives. Now let's make our directive. We'll start with a simple one that we can use to display information passed to it.  Step 1. Start your directive  Woot. When you're initializing your directive just remember that it works very similarly to how you start up a controller or a service. It can also be very helpful to think of your directive as a route.  Create your directive. You'll use the directive method on your angular module. It takes two arguments, the name string and the callback function, which will return the object that represents your directive. When naming your directive give it a name with two words; dirDisplay would be nice, but anything works. Just remember it's best practice to give a directive a camel case name so that it's clear in your html what it is. Also we're going to need a template html for our directive. We could do it inline, but let's make another file instead. Just name it something that makes sense for the name of your directive and put it in the same directory as your directive file. For your template just make a <div> and inside a <h1> tag that says User. Now in your home route html add in your directive. It will look like this if you named it dirDisplay: <dir-display></dir-display> Start up your app and go to the home route. Check and make sure you see User where your directive was placed. If you're not seeing it at this point it could mean a few things. Here's some more common issues. You didn't link your directive in your index as a script. Your name for your directive doesn't match the name in your html. Remember camel case becomes snake case so myDirective becomes <my-directive></my-directive>. You're file path to your html template is wrong. You have to think of file paths in angular as relative to the index. Here's some code to see just for this part, and just for the directive's js file.  var app = angular.module('directivePractice'); app.directive('dirDisplay', function(){   return {     templateUrl: 'app/directives/dirDisplay.html'   }; }); What we're returning is the directive object. You won't see anymore code in this tutorial so it's important you get things working right and refer back to what you've already done to advance from now on.  Step 2. Advancing directives  Your directive should be loaded up now, but it's not really doing much. Let's make it better.  In your home controller. Make a variable on your $scope called user. Set it's value to {   name: ""Geoff McMammy"",   age: 43,   email: ""geofdude@gmail.com"" } Now inside your directive's html specifically inside the <h3> tags display our new user's name. Then inside maybe some <h4> tags display his email and age. This is going to work exactly the same as if it was just inside your home controller. Reload the page and make sure it works. This is still very cosmetic and really not all that useful. It needs functionality.  Add into your directive's object the link property. The link property's value is a function definition that takes (generally) three parameters. scope, element, and attributes. Unlike in other places with angular injection these parameter names don't carry meaning. The first parameter will always represent your $scope for that directive, the second will always be the element that wraps your whole directive, and the third will always be an object containing all the properties and values of the attributes on your directive in the dom. Try the following to get a feel for all three.  Add two attributes to your directive in your html. Like this - <dir-display test=""myTest"" my-check=""checkItOut""></dir-display> Now in the link property you've added console.log the three parameters in the function. You'll see an object for scope that should look identical to the $scope of your html function. For element you'll see an object the represents the DOM wrapper for your directive. For attributes you'll see an object that will look like this:  {   test: ""myTest"",   myCheck: ""checkItOut"" } An important thing to notice is how it has again converted snake case to camel case for you. my-check became myCheck. Don't forget this. You'll run into this issue one day. It counts for both attributes and directive names.  To feel some of what the link function could do let's try this.  Add a ng-show to both the email and age wrappers. This should be familiar to you. Now inside your link function add a click event listener to your element property. It's going to look just like jQuery. element.on('click', function(){  }) Inside the click listener's callback add a toggle for the ng-show property you passed in. Along with a console.log to make sure things are connecting when you click. Try it out. Don't call for a mentor when it doesn't work. Let's talk about that first. You should see the console.log firing, but why isn't it toggling. This is going to be a common problem when working with the link function and event listeners. What we have here is an angular digest problem. The value is changing on the scope object, but the change isn't being reflected by our DOM. That's because angular isn't aware of the change yet. Anytime we cause an event to happen using something like jQuery or even angular's jQLite we need to let angular know that we've made a change.  Add this line of code in place of your console.log, scope.$apply(). Now try it out. It should be working now, so if you're still having issues it's time to debug. What we've done is forced angular to run it's digest cycle. This is where angular checks the scope object for changes and then applies those to the DOM. This is another good lesson to learn for later. You'll most likely hit this when making changes to your element using event listeners.  Step 3. Directive's re-usability.  Now our directive has some extremely basic functionality. One of a directive's greatest advantages though is its ability to be placed anywhere and still be functional. Let's say instead we had a list of users instead of just one.  Change the $scope property in your home controller to be users and give it this array as its value: [  {    name: ""Geoff McMammy"",    age: 43,    email: ""geofdude@gmail.com"",    city: ""Provo""  },  {    name: ""Frederick Deeder"",    age: 26,    email: ""fredeed@gmail.com"",    city: ""Austin""  },  {    name: ""Spencer Rentz"",    age: 35,    email: ""spencerrentz@gmail.com"",    city: ""Sacramento""  },  {    name: ""Geddup Ngo"",    age: 43,    email: ""geddupngo@gmail.com"",    city: ""Orlando""  },  {    name: ""Donst Opbie Leevin"",    age: 67,    email: ""gernee@gmail.com"",    city: ""Phoenix""  } ] Now in your home HTML add a ng-repeat to the directive call. Tell it to repeat for each user in users. Reload your page. It's working! But why? How does each directive instance know what information to display?  In the link function console.log the scope parameter. Make sure it's outside of your click listener. You'll see five print outs in your console. Open up any one of them and look to the bottom. Open up the user property. It's exactly what we would want! But again why would that be the case? Don't get too caught up in this next bit if it's too hard to understand, but the ng-repeat is essentially making new tiny scope objects for each individual user in our users array. Now each of our directives is still getting a user property on the scope object just like the directive wanted in the beginning. Woot.  Step 4. Ramp it up with Isolate Scope.  Directives can do so much more. So let's make that happen. That means we should make.... a new directive!!! This directive's purpose will be to display a selected User and the weather in his/her/its location. Link it up just like the last one.  Create a js file for our directive and name it dirWeather. Make an html file named dirWeather.html. Link it up in your index.html and add the template to your new directive object. In your directive's template give it an <h3> tag that says Weather just so we can know it's working. Above your ng-repeat on dirDisplay add your new dirWeather directive. If it's not working check the instructions above as to some common reasons why before asking a mentor for help. If you're seeing the Weather text on your page then we're ready to try out the dreaded Isolate Scope. The isolate scope object is one of the stranger API's in angular. I'm sorry but it is. Just refer to this for now.  scope: {  string: '@',  link: '=',  func: '&' } The properties on the scope object represent the attributes on the directive in the html. Our example scope object here would look something like this in the html. <example-directive string=""a string"" link=""user"" func=""updateUser()""></example-directive> The hard part here is the @, =, and &. They each have very important and distinct meanings.  @ says take in my attribute value as a string. = says take in my attribute value as a two-way bound variable from the parent scope. & says take in my attribute value as a reference to a function on the parent scope. It's also critical to point out that once you add a scope object you have no isolated your directive's scope. Meaning, aside from the values passed in through attributes, this directive has no connection to the $scope of its parent.  That being said let's isolate our directive's scope. :worried:  Add the scope property to your dirWeather. Give it the value of an object with a property of currentUser whose value is '='. Remember in your html this will look like current-user. This is the third time I've said so don't expect it again. This means that whatever comes into the currentUser attribute is going to be a value of the parent's scope object.  For now test this out by passing in users[0]. Find a way to show that users information inside your dirWeather's html. Remember inside your directive now the user is represented by currentUser. Step 5. &? &!?  The '=' value on your scope object has created a two-way binding between users[0] and currentUser. Now let's try out the '&'.  On your home controller add a function called getWeather. It takes one parameter called city. This function will make a call to a service so we'll need to create that. Make a weather service. Name it something cool and creative like weatherService. Inside the weather service make a function called getWeather that also takes one parameter, city. Make an $http get to this url - 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=' After the q= add on the city parameter. If you want you can test this out in postman. See what kind of data you get back. If it's the weather of that city then... you win! Use $q to return a promise that only resolves with the data you want. Temperature (preferably not in Kelvin) and the weather description. Use console.log on the data coming from the $http request to get to what you want. You'll need to add both on an object that you resolve your new promise with. On your home controller have it return the result of invoking the get getWeather function on the service. You should be returning a promise. Now in your home route's HTML pass in the getWeather function to the dirWeather directive through an attribute called weather-call. Add the attribute to your isolate scope object. That was a lot of linking, but let's walk through it. Your controller has a function linked to the service, which is in turn linked to your directive. So if you run the weatherCall function in your directive it will go through your controller to your service and then back.  Now things get a little bit tricky. Angular's way of passing along arguments through a directive to your controller are tricky, but once you understand how to do it, it's not hard. I'm going to give an example here of how it works.  <my-directive pass-func=""callFunc(data)""></my-directive> Here's how it would look in your HTML. But where's the data supposed to be coming from? It seems that you'd rather be able to pass in data from your directive. Well you still can, you just have to essentially tell angular what do use as an argument to replace data when it calls that function in your controller. The actualy function call inside the directive will look like this.  $scope.passFunc({data: wantedData}) So what you'll do is pass in an object where the property name is what the argument is named in the HTML where you call the directive. That might sound confusing, but just look at the two code blocks above for a pattern. Note that pass-func becomes $scope.passFunc and data is being replaced with wantedData with the {data: wantedData} object. In our directive we want to replace city in the attribute call, for something else inside the directive. You'll follow the same pattern as above.  For now let's get things set up for that function call.  Add to the dirWeather directive object a property called controller. It's value will be a function. Yes, this is a controller specifically for your one directive. It works the same as any other controller, except you don't give it a name. It's $scope object will only be accessible within an instance of your directive. Don't forget to inject $scope in the function.  Inside your controller function run the weatherCall function with the city property from the currentUser on your $scope. Here's where you need to make sure you've passed in a city argument in the attribute function call, and then replace that with your currentUser's city using an object with a city property. The function call should return a promise, so call .then afterward and add the data onto your $scope to display both the weather and temperature of the currentUser's city. The properties can be named whatever makes sense to you.  You may also want to find a way to get rid of all the decimal places on your temperature. Now you should have everything hooked up so it shows Geoff's data and the weather data for Provo. But is that good enough?  Step 6. Ramping up our ramp up.  Now let's change this so it shows the weather data for whichever user we select. We're going to need to use '&' again.  Make a function on the home controller that takes in a parameter and sets a property on the $scope to be that parameter. Maybe you see where this is going.  We want to get this function into our dirDisplay controller. But in order to do that we need to isolate dirDisplay's scope. This also means we need to pass in each individual user through the scope object as well.  To make it easier on ourselves, let's pass the current user from our ng-repeat into our directive through a user attribute. This way we can leave our two-way bindings as they are. Also pass our new function that sets our current user from our home controller into our directive through a setUser attribute.  You'll need to add an argument in there again. Go with user. Your scope object in dirDisplay should have two properties. setUser with the value of '&' and user with the value of '='. As before we're going to need to do some tricky stuff to get our argument back to our controller.  Call the setUser function inside our click event listener and pass in an object the sets our user argument to be the user on our directive's scope object. If you've forgotten this part go back up and take a look at how you did it before or the example in this README.  Whatever user you click on now should show up in the dirWeather directive as the current user. But we're missing one thing, we want to be able to see the weather for that user too. We'll have to do one more thing that will seem a little bit tricky at first, but it's good to learn if you don't know it already since it's actually used quite frequently.  We need to step up a change listener on our currentUser in the dirWeather directive. We'll use angular's $watch functionality. $watch is a method on your $scope that will watch for changes in a variable you give it. It works in two ways.  $scope.$watch('property', function(value){  console.log(""When $scope.property changes its new value is: "", value) }); And  $scope.$watch(function(){  return myVar }, function(value){  console.log(""When myVar changes its new value is: "", value); }); Remove the immediate function call that we have in there now. Maybe just comment it out for now because we'll use it in a bit. Now call the $watch method on your scope and have it watch currentUser. Either way of using $watch is fine. Have its callback run the $scope.weatherCall function just like you had it before.  One thing to note is that $scope.$watch will always run once to begin with. Since that's what we want here it's great, but just be aware of that.  If you've reached this point congratulate yourself. You've messed with some serious stuff today, namely directives. There are still a lot of things about directives that we can't possibly cover in a single project. If you like what we've done so far then you're in a good place to keep going. A developer who understands directives well can build a really clean looking code base. Just look at your home.html. It could have just two lines in it. If you're feeling good move on now to Step 7.  Step 7. Finishing touches  Try to work out these problems on your own.  There should be a way to let the user know that the weather data is loading. Something that appears while our $http request is retrieving our data. The $http request shouldn't fire on both opening and closing a user's information. A color change for the currently active user would be nicer than showing that user's info inside the dirWeather modal. Or at least less redundant. Whatever else you want. We still haven't explored transclusion and ng-transclude so give that a try if you're feeling adventurous. Just know that it's a way for deciding where to put the HTML child elements of a directive. It's cool stuff that can involve some criss-crossing of scopes.",https://api.github.com/repos/feiman/Angular-Directive-Project/commits,0,0,1,2016-08-24T04:18:29Z,2016-08-24T04:18:29Z
